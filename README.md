# My Start

In this repository are all my exercises carried out during my studies of the complete Web Design courses from Origamid.

I am starting in the world of development and I am passionate about design for this reason I am starting my steps with Frontend because I already work with UX / UI and now I want to go deeper into Web programming.

In this repository you will find my entire initial journey. It will contain all the material studied from the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript to the beginning of my advanced studies.

Enjoy!
